# ReviewSummarizer
Makes recommendations based on processing of restaurant review data

# Motivation
I created this project to test out an idea that I have for processing restaurant review data.  The goal here is that this code should process reviews and if possible, make a recommendation for which item to order.

# Installation
The code works with the the restaurant review data set available [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset).
